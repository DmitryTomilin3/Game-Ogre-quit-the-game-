# Game-Ogre-quit-the-game-
My mini game(Ogre quit the game).
Where you will control the mouse to exit the game. The game is simple and was created by one person (me) in 5 hours in the Godot 4 engine. I checked all the level, they can be passed. I made this game just for fun. Not that this is a very interesting project, but I think a free game with a small weight will not hurt anyone.
Installation instructions. To install the game, click on the Code button and select copy to zip. Next, a zip folder will be downloaded in which, when opened, there is a folder with the name of the game, open it. There is all the information about the game. In this folder, find a file named easy_project.tscn.Do not use the search for this! Open it. The whole game is running!
